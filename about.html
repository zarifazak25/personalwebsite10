                <h3>Research & Teaching</h3>
                <!-- CHANGE: Update with your research description -->
                <p>My research focuses on developing computational models that can understand and generate human language. I lead a team of graduate students working on problems ranging from machine translation to sentiment analysis. Our lab collaborates with industry partners and international research institutions.</p>
                
                <p>In my teaching, I strive to make complex concepts accessible while maintaining academic rigor. I regularly teach courses in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Algorithms, and have mentored over 30 graduate students.</p>

                <h3>Beyond Academia</h3>
                <!-- CHANGE: Update with your personal interests -->
                <p>Outside of research, I am an avid pianist and enjoy performing chamber music with colleagues. Music provides a creative counterbalance to my analytical work and has taught me valuable lessons about collaboration and practice.</p>
                
                <p>I also enjoy hiking in the nearby mountains and have developed an interest in nature photography. These outdoor activities help me maintain perspective and often provide unexpected moments of insight into research problems.</p>
                
                <p>I believe in maintaining work-life balance and encourage my students to pursue interests outside their academic work. Reading contemporary fiction and playing chess are other pastimes that keep my mind engaged in different ways.</p>
